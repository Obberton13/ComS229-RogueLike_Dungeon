2015/1/20 22:54 - Started project, created git repo, connected to private GitHub repo, created some files, and pushed. Yay. Things done, progress got.
2015/1/21 21:49 - created Makefile, got both main.c to compile with generator.c AT THE SAME TIME. Nice!
2015/1/21 22:09 - created a border around the edge of the map, immutable
2015/1/21 23:09 - created a command-line switch [-s seed] for adding a seed value to the random level generator. Also, a [--help] switch is made available.
2015/1/22 10:44 - added a function to generate a room. returns 0 on success, 1 on failure.
2015/1/22 22:15 - Now generates 12 non-overlapping rooms.
2015/1/25 16:28 - Made the map an enumerator, no longer a int value. Easier to deal with later.
2015/1/25 17:06 - Made the map an int again, because rock hardness.
2015/1/25 22:44 - Can now find the closest room from a certain room.
2015/1/25 23:23 - Connecting rooms works! Still errors with finding the closest unconnected.
2015/1/26 01:25 - All rooms now connect! Passageways are very straight, but that is fine for now.

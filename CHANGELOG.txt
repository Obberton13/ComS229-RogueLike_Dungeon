2015/01/20 22:54 - Started project, created git repo, connected to private GitHub repo, created some files, and pushed. Yay. Things done, progress got.
2015/01/21 21:49 - created Makefile, got both main.c to compile with generator.c AT THE SAME TIME. Nice!
2015/01/21 22:09 - created a border around the edge of the map, immutable
2015/01/21 23:09 - created a command-line switch [-s seed] for adding a seed value to the random level generator. Also, a [--help] switch is made available.
2015/01/22 10:44 - added a function to generate a room. returns 0 on success, 1 on failure.
2015/01/22 22:15 - Now generates 12 non-overlapping rooms.
2015/01/25 16:28 - Made the map an enumerator, no longer a int value. Easier to deal with later.
2015/01/25 17:06 - Made the map an int again, because rock hardness.
2015/01/25 22:44 - Can now find the closest room from a certain room.
2015/01/25 23:23 - Connecting rooms works! Still errors with finding the closest unconnected.
2015/01/26 01:25 - All rooms now connect! Passageways are very straight, but that is fine for now.
2015/01/27 10:44 - Passageways became twisting and turning.
2015/01/27 12:37 - Removed printf's from generator.c. They are not needed.

-----Project 1.02-----

2015/02/01 13:51 - Changed the entire project to use dungeon.h more. Added struct for the entire dungeon, which includes the rooms, which will be needed for this project.

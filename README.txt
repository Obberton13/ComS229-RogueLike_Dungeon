Project 1.09

The main() function is in the dungeon.cpp file. It got moved in the conversion from C to C++.

The first things that main() does is parse the items and the objects which was projects 1.07 and 1.08 (parseObjects() and parseDefs())

The actual Items and NPCS are in the Item.cpp and NPC.cpp, where the definitions are in ItemDef.cpp and NPC.cpp.

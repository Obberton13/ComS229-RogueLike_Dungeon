Project 1.04

The major new function that I used in this project was in pathfining.c.
move_monster(int monsterIndex);
	This is what moves the monsters and kills them and everything.

main()
	Detects the number of monsters, detects when the player is dead (or all of the monsters are dead) and finishes the game
